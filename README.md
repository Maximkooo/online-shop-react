# STAFF SHOP

<a href="https://staff-shop.netlify.app/">DEMO</a>

This application is a convenient online store with many useful features. Users can easily create an account, which allows them to save information about their purchases and speed up the ordering process. One of the key elements of the app is the ability to add items to a shopping cart, which makes it easy to create a shopping list. In addition, product search across the entire range of products, as well as categories and filters within them, make navigating through the store fast and convenient, helping customers find the products they need with ease. The task was to make a starter template for use in commercial projects.
